# Weather Forecast App

This is a simple weather forecast application that allows users to search for weather data in any city and view a 5-day forecast. The app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch real-time weather data.

## Features

- Current weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description)
- 5-day weather forecast
- Search for weather by city name
- Get weather based on your current location (using geolocation)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure of the app
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for dynamic functionality and API calls
- **OpenWeatherMap API** for fetching weather data

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. You need an internet connection to fetch live weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
2. You need a text editor (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) to modify the code.
3. A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to view the app.

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
